               <h2>About Our Coffees</h2>
               <p>Body (1-5 scale)</p>
               <p>The sensation of fullness in the mouth and how long it lingers is body. Full-bodied coffee combines long-lasting flavors with compounds that coat the taste buds, giving the mouth a sense of fullness. Brewing method also influences body. A French press or espresso machine allows more oils and fine particles into the finished brew, producing heavier-bodied coffee. Conventional drip machines use paper filters that trap particles and flavor oils, resulting in lighter-bodied coffees.</p>           
               <br>
               <p>Brightness-Acidity (1-5 scale)</p>
               <p>Brightness is the crisp first impression of a coffee's flavor sensed at the tip of the tongue. The brightest coffees have a snappy, palate-cleansing quality. Coffees with less brightness are soft and smooth, and dark roasts are less bright than light roasts of the same origin.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Flavor</p>
               <p>Flavor is the combined impression of a coffee's aroma, brightness, and body. There are 3 sets of coffee flavors, each perceived in a different part of the mouth. Front - Crisp flavors that form the first impression of a coffee, often described as citrusy, floral or winy. Mid - Rich, creamy notes that define a coffee's overall flavor, these flavors register at mid-tongue and on the upper palate. Descriptive terms abound - plum, berry, milk or dark chocolate, maple, caramel, malt, etc. Back - Deep savory and smoky notes that form the lingering impression of a coffee's taste, these are perceived from the base of the tongue into the throat. The flavors added by dark roasting fall mainly into this category, and include smoky, earthy, syrupy and bittersweet.</p>

               <h2>A Sampling of the Coffees We Carry</h2>
               <p>We don't always have all of these, but we rotate the roasts that are available as drip coffee and we usually carry a good selection of these in one pound bags. If you'd like to order a large amount of 1lb bags, please let us know in advance. Want to know what's on drip rotation before you come in? Give us a call and we'll let you know!</p>
               <br>
               <h2>Roaster-Featured Coffee</h2>
               <p>Every few months our coffee roasters feature a new roast which is usually more expensive and of higher quality. We offer this roast as a drip coffee rotation, and occasionally in one pound bags.</p>
